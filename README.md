# scoreKeeping
This is a project mostly based on Javascript and can be used to track down the score of 2 players.
The things that I have Learned in this project are:

1.The concept of DOM.

2.Using Selector in two ways
-using getElementByID()"
-using "querrySelector()"

3.DOM manipulation concept 
-methods such as classList,Textcontent,SetAttribute

4.Concept of Events
-got knowledge on different event type such as "click","change" e.t.c.
